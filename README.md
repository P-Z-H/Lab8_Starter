1. I would fit my automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. First of all, it will give immediate feedback to users. Also, it will tell users what errors they got so they can avoid such errors later. Fianlly, since it is within the Github action, users don't need to install pakages locally or learn new things.
2. No.
3. No. It seems that the messsage feature requires many intereactions with other features, but unit tests are not good at testing interactions.
4. Yes. Since the “max message length” feature is an individual part of the code, there are many benefits of using unit tests. For example, we only need to debug in a small scale, the debugging process is faster, and it will not affect other features.
